## DXX bucket token

- denominated in EUR or USD via an oracle

- 30% DAI and DGX
- 30% ETH
- rest diversified between the top N assets by liquidity, filtered manually to evaluate their potential

### Assets

The assets will be selected from the ERC20 assets with the biggest liquidity. Undervalued assets will be preferred.

In the future, using tokenized real-world assets will be a target as well.

### Automatic rebalancing

DXX will be a smart contract (or a 'bucket token') that holds different tokens (and ETH) in it.

To make the DXX automatically rebalance itself, it can offer a different price for withdrawing/depositing different assets depending on whether they're under/over. That way it will incentivise users themselves to rebalance it.
